# Generative Design MaxMSP package

This is a port of the [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/) library and stetch examples to Max/MSP. It also includes some of the functionality of the [p5js](https://p5js.org/) library to make porting the examples a little less painfull. Full credit should be given to the authors of the Generative Design book and the p5.js creators and community.

## Installation
